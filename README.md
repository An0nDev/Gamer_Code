#### what it do?
it auto submit a google form. it looks in your email for a new email with "breakout" in the subject and a (shortened or unshortened) url to a form, and then uses a simple algorithm to parse the form (get question and answer ids, types, and titles), generate a response, and submit the responses to google in parallel.
